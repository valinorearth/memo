## Carbon Net-Zero by 2050

According to UN's IPCC Reports[^IPCC6AR], right now, climate change is so severe we're running out of time to adapt. Global energy-related emissions alone need to drop __30% below 2019 levels by 2030__ and __75% by 2040__ to reach net-zero in 2050.

Governments have mandated companies to achieve Carbon Net-Zero by 2050. For instance, Oil and Gas companies such as
[BHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP),
[Chevron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation),
[Exxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon),
[Reliance Petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Petroleum),
[Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_plc),
and others need to reduce their CO₂ (Carbon Dioxide) emissions extensively.

Companies realized that investing at an early stage is much cheaper than inaction now.
Exxon has invested over $10 Billion since 2000,[^ExxonCCBudget] 
Shell over $3.2 Billion since 2016[^ShellCCBUdget], with a plan to increase to $2 Billion per year on its Climate Change initiatives.
Chevron has pledged $15 Billion from the start of 2022[^ChevronCCBudget].

## Carbon-Offset; How does it Work

One of the ways companies do this is by buying Carbon-Offset Credits, which allow them to balance out their climate impact. 

Every time a company uses its factories, machines, vehicles, or travel – they emit Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (CO₂e).[^CO2e]

These companies then buy carbon offsets. They contribute funds to certified projects such as forests restoration, clean energy generation, and increasing energy efficiency. These projects, in turn, reduce CO₂ and other Greenhouse gas emissions.[^GreenhouseGas]

## But there is a big problem

For companies to keep track of all their Carbon-Offset Credits, they rely on expensive consultants that produce costly spreadsheets and reports. The data is not even real-time. 

For instance, one of the ways Shell uses their billions is by creating an internal dashboard that shows real-time data of where they are buying these carbon-offset credits, how much impact they have made, and what other projects they can buy for lower prices.

Now, imagine having this same dashboard for every company – big and small – just for the price of a monthly subscription.

[//]: # Footnotes

[^6tUSD]: BloombergNEF's annual report, [New Energy Outlook](https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook/) (NEO) outlines the numbers associated with long-term scenario analysis on the future of the energy economy. The estimate investment in energy supply and infrastructure alone stands between $92 trillion and $173 trillion over the next thirty years. Annual investment will need to more than double to achieve this, rising from around $1.7 trillion per year today, to somewhere between $3.1 trillion and $5.8 trillion per year on average over the next three decades.

[^climate-change]: Contemporary [Climate-Change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) includes both global warming and its impacts on Earth's weather patterns. There have been previous periods of climate change, but the current changes are distinctly more rapid and not due to natural causes. Instead, they are caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane. Burning fossil fuels for energy use creates most of these emissions. Agriculture, steelmaking, cement production, and forest loss are additional sources. Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, allowing it through to heat the Earth's surface. When the Earth emits that heat as infrared radiation the gases absorb it, trapping the heat near the Earth's surface. As the planet heats up it causes changes like the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover, amplifying global warming.

[^IPCC6AR]: [The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/) assesses the impacts of climate change, looking at ecosystems, biodiversity, and human communities at global and regional levels. It also reviews vulnerabilities and the capacities and limits of the natural world and human societies to adapt to climate change.

[^shellcourt]: On May 26, 2021, a district court in [The Hague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague) ruled that [Shell must dramatically reduce](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/26/business/shell-court-case-climate-change/index.html) its carbon emissions in a landmark climate decision that could have far reaching consequences for oil companies.

[^ExxonCCBudget]: [Exxon is committed](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Sustainability/Environmental-protection/Climate-change) to providing affordable energy to support human progress while advancing effective solutions to address climate change.

[^ChevronCCBudget]: On Dec 1, 2021, Chevron [announced](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-announces-capital-and-exploratory-budget-for-2022) a spending program of $15 billion.

[^ShellCCBUdget]: Shell [announced its intention](https://unfccc.int/news/shell-vows-to-halve-carbon-footprint-by-2050-to-achieve-paris-goals) to halve its carbon footprint by 2050 and to increase its spending on clean energy to up to $2 Billion a year in order to help meet the goals of the Paris Climate Change Agreement.

[^CO2e]: Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (CO₂e) is a unit of measurement that is used to standardise the climate effects of various greenhouse gases.

[^GreenhouseGas]: [Greenhouse gas emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions) from human activities strengthen the greenhouse effect, causing climate change. Most is carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas. The largest emitters include coal in China and large oil and gas companies, many state-owned by OPEC and Russia. Human-caused emissions have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels.
